summary: In the process of troubleshooting our borewell submersible pump, to know if its gone bad, I learnt how underground water is stored; Holy Moly!!

# It took two days for the aquifer underneath us to recharge.

At night, at around 7, I noticed the water pressure from the bathroom tap was getting
low, indicating that the water in the tank was low.

So I turned on the pumping machine to bring up water from our borewell. It did its job, but halfway, it stopped bringing up water. Everybody in the house already knows how long the pumping machine takes to fill the tank, roughly 45 minutes. I noticed the pumping machine wasn’t bringing up water when I went to check after 30 minutes of turning on the pump. The first thing that came to my mind was that our pump has gone bad because I passed the pumping machine switch and saw the power button (red light) was still turned on, indicating the machine is actually turned on. Next, I ran to where the borehole was; I could hear the pumping machine spin but no water. I wondered why I could hear the machine spin; previously, all I could hear was the flow of water through the pipe. But this time around, I could literally hear the pump spin from around 100ft to 140ft below the ground. Our borehole length is around 140ft; the engineer gave us that information, but he didn’t tell us how far the pump went. I realized air was coming out from the pipe, so I guess this was why I could hear the machine spin; because there was air in the pipe, and the spinning sound was travelling through the air. I checked a blog and the blog was like you can get water up if you get rid of the air first; applying this principle to using a straw to sip from a coke bottle…you need to get rid of the air first in the straw by sucking, so the fluid follows. Anyway I noticed the pumping machine spun either anti-clockwise or clockwise – I couldn’t tell…but I notice like every 30secs, it tried to get rid of the air, and after that there was like a suction force for another 30secs, getting air into the pipe…anyway, since I read getting rid of the air helps the pump bring up water, I used my palm, blocking the pipe during that suction force period to prevent air from going into the pipe, then during period when the pump seemed It was expelling those air, I removed my palm, allowing the air in the pipe out. After like 5-10 cycles of that activity, I noticed a force of water come out, but it was whitish brown as hell, like It was muddy, and the rate of outflow reduced after a while; I needed to repeat the same activity in order to create pressure to help increase the flow rate. This alone helped me know the pumping machine wasn’t bad.<br/><br/>
Now, Underground water level getting low; Damn, never knew that could happen, I thought underground water was use till infinity. Anyway, I didn't know what was actually happening underground, because like everyother person, I thought underground water is like a water bank, for example lake, river or cave water. But nah, check the videos below to understand how water is stored underground:

Anyway fast forward, I didn’t want the pumping machine to get all muddy and
overall, get overheated due to pressure I was putting it on. **So all I had to
do was wait till the acquifer we were on got recharged.**

To cut the story short, my mum was suggesting we wait for raining season, but anyway I kept checking everyday in the afternoon, luckily I think it took the acquifer under us **two days** to recharge, and water came out at its usual flow rate.
